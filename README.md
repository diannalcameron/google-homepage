Started the Google-Homepage project on The Odin Project. I am to write code that duplicates the Google homepage, without any working links, and push the project to GitHub. I've already set up a repo on GitHub for google-homepage and pulled the repo from GitHub to my local machine, all using the Terminal. I'll be implementing HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code and using the developer tools on Google Chrome to try to mimic the code of Google's homepage as closely as possible to get the same visual. I'll write an update on the README.md file as a reflection after I've completed the project.

Finished the Google-Homepage project around a week ago, but didn't push to GitHub until a week or so later. There's stil more I could do to really make it match the Google homepage, such as adding a working search bar and editing the Apps and Account links. May return to do this later. I'd also like to recreate the top navigation bar using a nav list rather than divs. I had difficulty getting the left and right sides of the navigation bar to line up properly next to one another using divs, but I did eventually figure it out. Still, I think it would've been easier to do that and would improve semantics to use a nav list. Fun project overalll, and good practice / a good refresher on HTML and CSS.
